## yoooo i got ittttt less gooooo

[mailto link](https://jased.site/redirect/mailto)

### how did i get here?

pain.

### no really

first things first i decided i wanted jased@jased.site for my "developer contact" on everything that wanted one.

after doing some *extremely light* research, i learnt that [zohomail](https://zohomail.com) had everything i wanted.. which is just a custom domain

i sign up... oh my this was long

my phone number was in use to ANOTHER ACCOUNT, and i had to remove it from other said account.

i set up the new account and it wanted some dns reconds. understandable

### dns records.

you know its bad when ^^^^^

SO, after a couple minutes of adding the records and after an hour with getting it to register, it just wouldnt. even with a TimeToLive set to *5 minutes* with a priority of **ninety nine**, it wouldnt do it.

i did a test with emailing from my personal email to my new email

it didnt go through so i kept going on with the dns records and nameservers (which i didnt need by of the way) until finally... i gave up.

as a last ditch attempt i decided to email my personal email *from* my new email and finally...

#### IT WORKED YES
