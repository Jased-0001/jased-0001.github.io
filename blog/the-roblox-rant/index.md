## some "incidents" that happened with roblox

### 1: random ban

my friend got ~~banned~~ deleted for no reason. no, wait, they had ***a*** reason.

it was for "inappropriate content"

**it was a tank SOMEONE ELSE added to a studio.**

**OH MY GONCH THIZ PERSO N HAZ A TONK IN DE GAEM. I NEEd TO MAZZ REPORT THIS [Inappropriate Content]**

### 2: refusal to end subscription

i have premium, k?

so, i can ~~see~~ not see the "cancel" button for premium,

so i email them.

..

they reply with "Oh, we can't cancel a Google Play subscription!"

i dont play on mobile or have premium with google play.

### 3. robux tax

so, roblox takes a cut on stuff as simple as taking money from a creator's tshirt

from the 100 robux gamepass, you only get **i think** only 70.

not really a big deal but its kinda stupid.

### 4. conclusion

roblox is a good game im not gonna lie, but they are falling apart.

from the sunset of r6, and the forceful switch to their all-in-one application, who knows what else they'll do.

and with all that said,

**goodbye!**
