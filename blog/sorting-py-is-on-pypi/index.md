[algorsort link](https://pypi.org/project/algorsort/)

on /projects i have "sorting-py", and i just now decided

why dont i make it fully public, like pip public

i **did** have *some* troubles, such as the name i want not being allowed or it being taken.

i have nothing to say today because this announcement is not that big

sorting.py is actually kind of bad, i used github copilot and the help() was just '{name of algorithm} sorting'

# *** =========== ***

and with all that said...

**Goodbye!**
